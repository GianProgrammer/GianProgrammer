# My profile

- 👋 Hi, I’m @GianProgrammer. I’m a Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I combine technical knowledge with creativity to develop practical solutions and projects.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, programming languages, and automation projects. I also have a strong appreciation for coffee culture, thanks to my barista training, which taught me patience, precision, and attention to detail.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and improving my skills in C, my primary programming language. One of my personal projects involves automating a web page using Python. I aim to explore more automation ideas as a hobby and a way to enhance my programming expertise.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve automation, web development, or creative programming ideas. I value teamwork and enjoy contributing to projects where I can share and learn new skills.
  
- 📫 How to reach me Feel free to contact me via email or social media. I’m always open to connecting with people who share similar interests or have exciting projects in mind.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I know the first 25 digits of Pi! This reflects my interest in mathematics and problem-solving. Also, I take pride in my soft skills, such as effective communication, adaptability, and teamwork, which I believe are just as important as technical expertise.
