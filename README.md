# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @GianProgrammer. I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I combine technical knowledge with creativity to develop practical solutions and projects.<br><br>üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in software development, programming languages, and automation projects. I also have a strong appreciation for coffee culture, thanks to my barista training, which taught me patience, precision, and attention to detail.<br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Python and improving my skills in C, my primary programming language. One of my personal projects involves automating a web page using Python. I aim to explore more automation ideas as a hobby and a way to enhance my programming expertise.<br><br>üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects that involve automation, web development, or creative programming ideas. I value teamwork and enjoy contributing to projects where I can share and learn new skills.<br><br>üì´ How to reach me: Feel free to contact me via email or social media. I‚Äôm always open to connecting with people who share similar interests or have exciting projects in mind.<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact: I know the first 25 digits of Pi! This reflects my interest in mathematics and problem-solving. Also, I take pride in my soft skills, such as effective communication, adaptability, and teamwork, which I believe are just as important as technical expertise.
